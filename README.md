# Birthday Card

Made a birthday card (in flutter) for my mom.

Card features:
  - loading splash screen
  - confetti
  - page turning to give the effect of a physical card
  - scaled text widgets + custom font
  - images and videos for a trip down the memory lane :)

# Steps to customize for your loved ones

1. create an assets folder inside the root directory.
2. inside assets create three folders fonts, images, & videos.
4. inside fonts place any font file in ttf format (can be downloaded from google fonts).
5. edit font path in pubspec.yaml (last line).
6. inside images and videos, place the images and videos of your choice.
7. edit paths to images and videos, and text being displayed in lib\my_card\page_one to lib\my_card\last_page
8. build apk and send it your loved one!
